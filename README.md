In the Viking Hacks Hackathon, we built a website for farming named Farmers Only. In this website, we use Python to prompt the user and Tkinter. In the back-end (Python), the user’s parameters are run through datasets and are compared to different crops to find the optimal crop (considering the seeds from each crop per acre) for a farmer to gain the best profit per acre. The parameters that the code prompts the user are the location of the land and the farmer’s budget (considering the cost per seed) for the plants. The location of the farm is converted into coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) where the average rainfall and temperature is determined using the Meteo API. The front end, using Tkinter, inputs the user’s parameters into the code to print out a result. This result is displayed on a website created using Tkinter and makes a UI for the program.
